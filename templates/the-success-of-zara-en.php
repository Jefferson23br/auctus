            <p>
                Zara was founded in 1975 by Amancio Ortega in A Coruña, Spain. Initially, the brand started as a clothing manufacturer before expanding into retail. The first Zara store offered high‑quality clothing at affordable prices, which quickly attracted a large number of customers.
