            <h2>1. Immersion and Diagnosis of Your Digital Stage</h2>
            <p>
                Before suggesting any website, e-commerce, or system, we understand the <strong>full context</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How you generate clients today (online and offline);</li>
                <li>Which channels you already use (Instagram, Google, paid traffic, referrals, etc.);</li>
                <li>Your current bottlenecks (low conversion, slow website, no digital presence, manual processes, etc.);</li>
                <li>The goals you want to achieve (more sales, recurrence, scale, automation, authority);</li>
                <li>The stage your business is in (beginning, validation, growth, expansion).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                From this immersion, we build a <strong>tactical diagnosis</strong> with clear priorities, risks,
                and opportunities. This is where we define, together with you, <strong>where it makes the most sense to invest first</strong>.
